# A casino game

A casino game implemented in Java. It was an R&D project of me and my teammates. We have implemented a casino game which includes four subgames like rolling a dice, yahtzee or tossing a coin. We wnated to show about the probabilites of winning( and losing) and the dangers of gambling.

We have used Java and Netbeans. But it can be installed on a different IDE. Also we have used JavaFX, so you need to install JavaFX 11 for this project. But you can find some screenshots and the results in the report.
